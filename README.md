# DiplomaProject_LoRa_IoT_System

This is my diploma project. I designed a small, energy-efficient IoT node using LoRa protocol. Using trial and error numerical simulation, I found a way to miniaturise the antenna of the device working in the 868 MHz band. I also set up a proof of concept IoT network using a Raspberry Pi as a LoRa gateway, with the node transmitting temperature sensor data. The data was shown in a neat web UI.
